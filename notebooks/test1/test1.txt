History
Bangladesh Liberation War initially commenced in the form of resistance movement as the Pakistan Army cracked down on 25 March 1971 primarily at Dhaka and subsequently extending it to the entire of Bangladesh. Gradually, the Bangladesh Forces organised small groups of guerrilla fighters who followed 'hit and run'[5] tactics. As a third stage in the war, the Bengali military personnel who were members of Pakistan Army, Navy and Air Force deserted their respective units to join Bangladesh Forces and organised them into regular units across the border of Indian territory primarily as Land Force. A small group of naval commandos also opened the naval wing and a few pilots and airmen formed the air wing.[citation needed]

Bangladesh Army After a prolonged guerrilla warfare was launched by Bangladesh Forces, which continued for a number of months. A further restructuring was undertaken, and the Bangladesh Forces were organised into three brigade size combat groups.

'Z' Force,:[3] Lieutenant Colonel Ziaur Rahman was the commander of this force. The brigade was formed with the 1st, 3rd and 8th Battalion of East Bengal Regiment on 7 July 1971. The Z Force was raised at the foothills of Tura hill, opposite to Mymensingh.[3]
'K' Force: Lieutenant Colonel (later Brigadier) Khaled Mosharraf was the commander of this force. The brigade was formed at Agartala,[3] with the 4th, 9th and 10th Battalion of East Bengal Regiment on the month of September 1971.
'S' Force: Major K M Shafiullah was the commander of this force. The Brigade was formed at Hezamara,[3] with the 2nd and 11th Battalion of East Bengal Regiment on the month of October 1971.[6]
Bangladesh Navy Many of the Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy decamped, to form an emerging Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships BNS Padma (1973) and PALASH and 45 navy personnel. They prevented the supply of arms, ammunitions and rations for the occupation forces. This operation from the Naval Commandos made Ports in Chittagong and Mongla highly lethal for the occupation forces.[3]

Bangladesh Air Force The official date of formation of the Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) has been established as 28 September 1971 and it was launched formally by the Government on 8 October 1971. BAF was formed with all officers and airmen of Bengali origin serving in the Pakistan Air Force prior to the war. Out of 11 BDF Sectors, the most tactically significant sector, the Central Sector â€“ Sector 11, was in command of a BAF officer including Sector 6. The BAF started their operation from an abandoned airfield at Dimapur.[3]
